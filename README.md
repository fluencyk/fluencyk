### Hey, I can cook delicious Chinese cuisine for you!
### And thanks for your kind visit! ;D
👋 Hi, I’m @fluencyk, aka Yujun Kong. You can call me Yujun or Eugene. I am a Master's student at Stevens Tech in the US.
👀 I’m interested in Software Engineering, Application System Architecture, Computer Science, Human-Computer Interaction, Usability Testing Research, User Experience Design, and Digital Art. I am also especially interested in researching the technology of Environmental Computation, which is a mutation of Smart Cities but far more advanced.
🌱 I’m currently learning programming fundamentals, data structures/algorithms, and framework design and implementation in Java, Python, and C. I'm also practicing another front-end language, such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, or coding frameworks, such as React, Vue, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on software development with anyone possible.
